_YOU.inc needs a CEO_

### If a [corporation is a human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood), then a human can be a corporation. And YOU.inc needs a CEO to stay focused, effective and efficient.

## Ever felt like your life needs a CEO?
Someone who would give you a kick when you are procrastinating.
Someone who would help you prioritze your daily tasks based on your life's long-term goals.
Someone who would call you in the morning and tell help you build your to-do list for the day.
Someone who would send you on vacation when you really need one (and you don't know it yourself).
Someone who would send you an invite for a monthly performance review about your life's progress.
Someone whose sole job is helping you succeed (whatever success means for you), despite your own weaknesses?

## Meet AIchief, your personal Chief Executive

AIchief is an open-source AI-powered boss that will take care of the "management" of your life, so that you can focus on living it, and achieving whatever you want to achieve.

#### Here is how it works (should work;):

1. You "hire" your personal AIchief by installing it on your own infrastructure or signing up for a hosted solution (coming soon...)
2. You "align" your AIchief by:
    - telling it about your overall life goals and values 
    - configuring your preferred "management style" and "personality" (including gender, style etc.)
    - configuring your preferred method for your AIchief to influence you (e.g. financial incentives, emotional manipulation etc.)
    - setting up KPIs for your AIchief (a.k.a. the reward function)
    - configuring your AIchief's "compensation model" (in a hosted solution - this defines when and how you pay money. In a self-hosted solution, this is entirely virtual.). Examples of "compensation models": fixed fee (monthly "salary"), fail fee (you pay when you fail to achieve your goals because you were lazy/distracted), success fee (you pay when you achieve what you set out to achieve)
    - configuring your preferred communication channels (calendar invites, calls, chat, to-do lists etc.) and check-in moments (daily stand-up, weekly summaries, quarterly reviews etc.)
3. That's it, your AIchief is up and running and YOU.inc is now in good hands, ready to deliver

#### From now on, your life will stay organized

##### Below is an example of a daily routine, powered by AIchief (preferred aggressive management style by phone):

- wake up 7:30 am to a call from AIchief telling you it's time to go to the gym, if you have excuses - it will remind you why you wanted to do it and will play back to you your own commitment.
- after you open your laptop after the gym, you see an invite in your calendar for a morning stand-up with your Chief, which you can join via a Zoom link
- during the standup call your AIchief asks you about how the tasks from yesterday are going. If you haven't finished them - Chief interrogates why and helps you break them down into smaller pieces. Chief also checks in on your energy levels and asks you if anything new has come up etc. At the end of the conversation, your chief makes a ToDo list for you for the day
- Chief asks you if it would help if she allocated timeslots for each task and sent you invites to block your calendar and if you agree your chief does so
- During the day your friend Sara calls and asks you to get involved in a project. The project sounds interesting but you are not sure whether you should go for it. Instead of answering straight away you say that you need some time to think and align with you boss. You message your Chief and tell her about the project. AIchief asks follow-up questions and eventually tells you whether and how you can get involved, offering to also get an assistant LLM to draft an email for you, so that you can send it to Sara.

##### In addition (or instead of) daily micromanagement, AIchief engages in a higher-level management of your life, for example:

- Chief sends you a weekly progress assessment and feedback on what was great and what could be improved
- Chief has quarterly "personal development" conversations with you, where she invites you to re-assess whether the previously set personal values and priorities still hold. Chief also invites you to reflect on what worked well and not so well during this quarter.
- Chief issues "quarterly reports" about performance to the shareholders of YOU.inc (i.e. to you) which helps you reflect on your journey. The quarterly reports take into account the costs and time it took to have the YOU.inc up and running, so you can see how much $ and time you spent on YOU.inc setup, vs. how much value it is producing for you.
- If you keep ignoring your Chief and/or your stated goals never get closer, your Chief will resign, suggesting that you hire a new Chief who will manage you differently.


## AIchief doesn't work alone

Chief is just the CEO of YOU.inc, but she is not the only "person" working for you. Chief employs multiple other lower-level specialist agents who help run various aspects of your life. For example:

- CFO - a specialized model focused on making sure you are financially in line with your goals (whether those be earning or giving money or both)
- HR - a specialized model focused on your wellbeing
- Chief Impact Officer - a specialized model, focused on your social and/or environmental impact (if this is something you decide is important for you during your priorities and values conversation)
- CMO - a specialized model responsible for your external image, personal brand and popularity (if this is something you decide is important for you)
- multiple assistants who can help with scheduling, writing drafts, negotiating deals, designing things etc.
- ...etc.

These additional models, that your Chief can employ, function like plugins (coming at additional cost in the hosted version).

## AIchief is just a dream for now

This is something I've been thinking about for a long time, but haven't started building. But now (with open source LLMs getting to a decent level) it looks like it can finally be built. I believe in building it open-source style from scratch. If enough people have an interest, we can get going right here.

I think the place to start will be to develop the simplest version of AIchief that just helps you set goals and build your todos for the day and then checks back on you. The whole interaction can be done via a chatbot (Telegram/Whatsapp) for the beginning and maybe email (for calendar blocking). The rest (like voice) can be added later.

But I'm not sure how to build it. Ideas (and more importantly contributions) are very very welcome.

Love,
